So this is me editing my first README file. The current project is to setup an incredibly basic website using the html I've learned so far. The skills that I will demonstrate in this project include using html to create links, images, lists, etc. I will also be learning how to commit my projects using git and github. I'll update this once I'm finished with a self reflection. Edit 0021 - I've completed the project and I feel incredible about it. It's the first time I've ever coded something completely from scratch; even though it's at the most basic level. I'm excited to move on in my studies and get to some higher level stuff. Thank you TOP & TOP discord members.
